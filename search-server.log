19:15 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesHi Guys i'm using the webservices on musicbrainz to get the xml data. I currently have the musicbrainz server up and running on AWS. Would the alternative search server be more scalable? I'm not using the website at all. I just need to search the data. The average client will be making around 1000 requests in around 1minute.
19:15 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeif you're doing entirely searches (and no browse requests, which people sometimes thing are searches) then you're not using the server really at all, it just proxies searches to the search server
19:16 <freenode> UmkaDK has left IRC (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
19:16 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaethe default config uses our search server, which with that many requests you'd presumably rapidly get ratelimited
19:16 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaethink*
19:16 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesI see I had no idea the musicbrainz server used the search.musicbrainz.org services
19:17 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeit's the LUCENE_SERVER configuration variable in DBDefs, if you look
19:17 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesI thought once I had a musicbrainz server it was self contained... :(
19:17 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidae(the defaults are in lib/DBDefs/Default.pm)
19:17 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeit is as far as lookups and browse, but yeah, not for search
19:18 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesI see so I just need to tinker with that to make the requests to my own postgres instance?
19:18 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeit's not a postgres instance thing, it's making requests to a lucene search server. so if you want to not use search.musicbrainz.org you'll need to set up a search server
19:18 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesto clarify i'm using /ws/2/recording/?query=
19:19 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeyes, that's just proxying it to search.musicbrainz.org then
19:19 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaehttps://bitbucket.org/metabrainz/search-server is what you'll need to set up, and then configure your musicbrainz-server instance to use wherever you've set that up instead, or you can just use it directly if you don't need lookup or browse requests
19:19 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesAh Okay. Wish I knew this earlier. It took me about 3 days over christmas to get it up and running. Oh well.
19:20 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> kunomichaeljames: luckily the search server is easier to get running, though it will take some time to create indexes.
19:20 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesAwesome
19:20 <freenode> reoafk is now known as reosarevok
19:20 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeit also sounds likely you're using this commercially, with that many requests, so you may want to contact rob (rob at musicbrainz dot org for email)
19:21 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesOnce I have the search server running I could just directly query that?
19:21 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> chirlu` has joined (4d154d23@gateway/web/freenode/ip.77.21.77.35)
19:21 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesIts by no means commercial yet. Its just me trying to make a demo
19:22 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeand yes, you should be able to query the search server directly. the URL parameters are minorly different but it shouldn't be too hard to figure out (main difference is if you want JSON-formatted data)
19:22 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidae(where you need to use fmt=jsonnew when querying the search server directly
19:22 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamescool but I hear that json isn't a fully supported type in ws/2?
19:23 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesand if there's bugs its unlikely it will be fixed.
19:23 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaeit's at the very least under-tested
19:23 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesws/3 will be json but thats not on the horizon just yet
19:24 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaedepends on your horizon :) but in general yes
19:24 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesI need it to be pretty stable. so will be using my NodeJS server to make the requests and parse the responses
19:24 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesCool So what branch is should I use to get started with the search server?
19:24 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljames*Cool So what branch is should I use to get started with the search server?
19:25 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> ianmcorvidaemaster, presumably
19:26 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamescool and setup documentation is in master aswell?
19:26 <#MusicBrainz-Devel> michaeljamesas for replication, cron job to get the data? Use mbslave?
